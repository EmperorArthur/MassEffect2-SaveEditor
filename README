This is a save editor for Mass Effect 2

Currently, this only supports extracting savegames, and seems to have issues on windows systems.

All of this is based off of Gibbed's ME2 save editor.
He did a wonderful job, and I'm still not sure what I was thinking of making my own instead of expanding on his.
All the code is mine, but you might notice that a few variable names are the same.

To Do:
	Finish parsing ME3 Save file.
		With the improvements made, quite a few things in ME3Format can be moved to MEShared.
			Don't do this right now.
			I'll probably end up with a unified ME Save Format that will work with ME2 and ME3, so I'm waiting to merge the files.
	Handle Head Morphs
		Currently this code asserts and dies with a charachter that has a head morph.
	Change all the READ4's in my code to ReadInt and ReadFloat
		This will allow me to easily modify the code if I'm ever running on a system where ints and floats aren't 4 byte little endian values.
	Modify guid output so it looks better.
		The output using the guid object just doesn't look as good as it can.
	Create write functions for my objects.
		This is fairly straightforward, but takes time to actually write.
	Figure out how to calculate a CRC32 value.
