This is a save editor for Mass Effect 2

Currently, this only supports extracting savegames, and seems to have issues on windows systems.

All of this is based off of Gibbed's ME2 save editor.
He did a wonderful job, and I'm still not sure what I was thinking of making my own instead of expanding on his.
All the code is mine, but you might notice that a few variable names are the same.
See here for more:  http://blog.gib.me/

To Do:
	Fix the crash at exit bug on windows systems.
		There is an unused variable that seems to cause the problem.
		However, when it's removed LevelRecords start repeating the second name seen.
		The weird thing is that, not only does it not crash on my linux machine, but valgrind reports no errors.
		I'm going to try testing with different save files to see if I can replicate the problem on my linux box.
	Create write functions for my objects.
		This is fairly straightforward, but takes time to actually write.
	Figure out how to calculate a CRC32 value.
